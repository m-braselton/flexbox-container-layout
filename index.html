            <p>I am a <span>Responsive Designer & Developer</span> who loves to sit down with clients and develope new ways to make thier websites unique and appealling. When I'm not working on someones websight, I am exploring new ways to apply the latest technology. Right now my favorite tools are HTML, CSS, Github, and Javascript.</p>

              <p>I was born in Atlanta Georgia and lived there about 3 years. By the time I finished high school I had attended 10 different schools and lived in 5 different states. When I was 19, I found my home in the Sierra Nevada mountains. I have worked in Yosemite for 40 years now.</p>

            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
              <p>I started college in my late thirties. That is where I met my phillipina wife Rose. We have travelled to the Phillipines numerous times and have recently purchased a beautiful house there. Outside of Yosemite we have 10 acres with a house on top of a small mountain.</p>

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
              <p>I love to take on new challenges and learn new skills. Living in the mountains, I have learn to be my own plumber, electrician, and carpenter. I also own and run a small saw mill. At age 50, I learned to fly a paraglider and have now logged over 500 hours in the air!</p>
